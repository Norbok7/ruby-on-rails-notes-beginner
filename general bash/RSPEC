2/8/24 rspec testing guidelines and class notes
ruby on rails ships with many tests
when you run rails s it states starting in devleopment 
rails c loads development environment, and it states that

Faker::Address.methods become available

run bundle exec rspec so you can test your specific part of the projec tnot everything. in ex. group project.
can also run rspec

pending means its reminding us to add test files to this. 

RSpec.describe Blog, type: :model do
  context "validations tests" do
    it "is not valid without a title" do 
      user = User.new(first_name: "John", last_name: "doe", email: "test@test.com", username: "johndoe123")
      blog = Blog.new(content: "sample content", user: user)
      expect(blog).not_to be_valid 
      # essentially filled out everything properly except the title aka requires title      
    end
  end
end

RSPEC not only for testing models, but to test REQUESTS
rails g rspec:request Blogs

demonstration of using REQUESTS

SETUP FACTORY BOT
helps to easily setup/build Blogs
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :blog do 
    title {Faker::name.}
  end
end

in rails_helper add in config of railshelper.rb
config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
